Imagine a boy... or even better, a bot... that serves you beer... or even better, a beverage... \
We bring you a state-of-the-art, portable beverage dispensing robot somewhat shaped like a monolith that comes with an interactive ashtray, perfect for a shady picnic or while lounging around on a relaxing beachfront — the applications are endless.

## Project Overview
This portion of the system is comprised of the following components:
- Raspberry Pi 3B
- USB Microphone
- USB Speaker
- Piezo element
- Drink dispensing belt

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- PyAudio
- OpenAI Whisper
- TBD

Here is an abstracted visualization of the project that the above text describes:\
